# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

I wanted a study guide i could refer to by using my broswer to help me study for coding bootcamp. By building this webpage, I have a better understanding of HTML, CSS, Javascript, and Github. This allows me to come back and remember my coding actions as well as revisit and redo them as I please. This will continue to help me learn coding and debugging.

This study guide will contain notes and information referring to the topics covered in the prework portion of bootcamp. The DevTools show the Javascript in action as awell as suggest a topic to study if one is unsure which topic they would like to revisit.
